## Relay description
- Description:
AEDIKO 4pcs Relay Module DC 5V 1 Channel Relay Board with Optocoupler Isolation Support High or Low Level Trigger

- About this item:
5V Relay Module:
-- Working Voltage: DC 5V;
-- Maximum Load: AC 250V/10A, DC 30V/10A;
-- Trigger Current of Opto-Isolator: 5mA
Fault-Tolerant Design: Fault Tolerant Design, Even if the Control Line is Broken, the Relay will not Operate;All Interfaces of Relay can be Wired Out Through the Terminals Directly,Normally Open and Normally Closed
-- Optocoupler Isolation: 1 Channel Relay Board use Optocoupler Isolation that has Strong Driving Ability and Stable Performance,The Isolation Circuit Prevent Damages to I / O Port by Relay Switch Current
-- Jumper Design: The Relay Module has a Jumper That You Can Set Rather the Unit State Changes with High or Low Signal. Has Screw Terminals for Relay (NC,C,NO) and for Input; Coil +, Coil - and Trigger.
-- Wide Application: DC 5V Relay Module Works Well with ARM /PIC /AVR /MCU/Raspberry/CNC Machine/ PS4 etc.
